Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
to pause the application at that point so we can step into the functions and see what they are doing or step over to run the next line
2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
no
3. How do we debug the next line of code?
step over
4. What does the step into command do?
we can see the elements of that line
5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
evaluate expression runs only 1 function and evaluate code fragment can run multiple lines of code or methods and create temporal variables to test the code.
